# GOV.UK PaaS Technical Documentation

This is the new technical documentation system for GOV.UK PaaS.

It is published at https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk (for technical reasons, it is also available at https://paas-tech-docs.cloudapps.digital but that is NOT the official address and you should not send cloudapps.digital URLs to tenants, link to them etc).

## Getting started

Clone this repository to a folder on your computer.

Install Ruby with Rubygems, preferably with [Ruby version manager](rvm),
and the [Bundler gem](bundler).

In the application folder, type the following to install the required gems:

```
bundle install
```

## Making changes

To make changes, edit the markdown files in the `source` folder.

Although a single page of HTML is generated, the markdown is spread across
multiple files to make it easier to manage. They can be found in
`source` and the tpoc directories contained within.

The ordering is controlled by frontmatter, the `layout.csv` file contains the
variables used in populating the frontmatter it follows this format `path to
file, title to be displayed, page id, page numerical order,` once this has been
updated the frontmatter needs to be regenerated by executing the metadata
script with `./metadata.sh` the build can then be run as usual.

Avoid editing any of the following:

+ source/images/*
+ source/javascripts/*
+ source/layouts/*
+ source/stylesheets/*
+ source/favicon.ico

as this will make it a lot harder to stay up to date with any changes made to the template.

Images to be included in the docs are kept in `source/documentation/figures`

In order to configure some aspects of layout, like the header, edit ``config/tech-docs.yml``.

## Preview

Whilst writing documentation, you can run a middleman server to preview how the
published version will look in the browser.

The preview is only available on your own computer. Others won't be able to
access it if they are given the link.

Type the following to start the server:

```
bundle exec middleman server
```

If all goes well something like the following output will be displayed:

```
== The Middleman is loading
== LiveReload accepting connections from ws://192.168.0.8:35729
== View your site at "http://Laptop.local:4567", "http://192.168.0.8:4567"
== Inspect your site configuration at "http://Laptop.local:4567/__middleman", "http://192.168.0.8:4567/__middleman"
```

You should now be able to view a live preview at http://localhost:4567.

Changes to the `tech-docs.yml` file require stopping and restarting the server to show up in the preview. (Stop it with `Ctrl-C`).

## Running tests

This repo is configured in Travis to run a link-checker over the generated docs
to find any broken links etc. If you want to run this locally, do the
following:

```
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -Ur requirements.txt
./release/test
```

## Build and deploy

The docs are hosted on the PaaS and any change to master is automatically deployed by the [PaaS release CI](https://github.com/alphagov/paas-release-ci). The build status can be seen here: https://concourse.build.ci.cloudpipeline.digital/teams/main/pipelines/paas-tech-docs

To deploy your changes manually:

Make sure you have the correct PaaS permissions to push to the org `govuk-paas` in the space `docs`.

Push your changes to Github (on the main branch).

Run `./release/build && ./release/push` from the application folder.

## Updating the template

The master repository for the tech docs template system is at https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template

See the section "Updating a project to use the latest template" at https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template

The template system is maintained and developed by the service design manual team.  You can contact them at `#tech-docs-format` on GDS Slack. Note that this is an MVP version and there is a roadmap of planned features and improvements.
