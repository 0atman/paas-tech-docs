# GOV.UK PaaS Technical Documentation

This is the new technical documentation system for GOV.UK PaaS. 

The official docs to give out to tenants are still the old readthedocs system hosted at https://government-paas-developer-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ - however, that will change very shortly.

The *temporary* URL for the new system is https://paas-tech-docs.cloudapps.digital/ - do not publicise this, give it to tenants etc. The permanent URL will be https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk and will start working soon.

Do not update the docs content on the old system; update it here.


## Getting started

To preview or build the website, we need to use the terminal.

Install Ruby with Rubygems, preferably with [Ruby version manager][rvm],
and the [Bundler gem][bundler].

In the application folder type the following to install the required gems:

```
bundle install
```

## Making changes

To make changes edit the source markdown files in the `source` folder.

Although a single page of HTML is generated, the markdown is spread across
multiple files to make it easier to manage. They can be found in
`source/documentation`.

A new markdown file isn't automatically included in the generated output. If you
add a new markdown file at the location `source/documentation/agile/scrum.md`,
the following snippet in `source/index.html.md.erb` will include it in the
generated output.

```
<%= partial 'documentation/agile/scrum' %>
```

Including files manually like this lets you specify the position they appear in
the page.

Avoid editing any of the following:

+ source/images/*
+ source/javascripts/*
+ source/layouts/*
+ source/stylesheets/*
+ source/favicon.ico

as this will make it a lot harder to stay up to date with any changes made to the template.

In order to configure things like the header, edit ``config/tech-docs.yml``.

## Preview

Whilst writing documentation you can run a middleman server to preview how the
published version will look in the browser. 

The preview is only available on your own computer. Others won't be able to
access it if they are given the link.

Type the following to start the server:

```
bundle exec middleman server
```

If all goes well something like the following output will be displayed:

```
== The Middleman is loading
== LiveReload accepting connections from ws://192.168.0.8:35729
== View your site at "http://Laptop.local:4567", "http://192.168.0.8:4567"
== Inspect your site configuration at "http://Laptop.local:4567/__middleman", "http://192.168.0.8:4567/__middleman"
```

You should now be able to view a live preview at http://localhost:4567.

Some changes (e.g. to the header) require stopping and restarting the server. (Stop it with `Ctrl-C`).

## Build and deploy

The docs are hosted on the PaaS.

To deploy your changes:

Make sure you have the correct PaaS permissions to push to the org `govuk-paas` in the space `docs`.

Push your changes to Github (on the main branch). 

Run ``./script/deploy``.
