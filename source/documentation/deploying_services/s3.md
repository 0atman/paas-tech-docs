# Amazon S3

Amazon S3 provides object storage through a web service interface.

<h2 id="set-up-the-service">Set up the service</h2>

### Provision an Amazon Web Service S3 bucket

To create a service instance, you must provision an Amazon Web Service (AWS) S3 bucket.

The name of the service overall is `aws-s3-bucket`. There is one type of plan for the service, named `default`. This plan is unlimited in terms of data you can download, storage, and resource in general.

#### Provision a private AWS S3 bucket

By default, S3 buckets you provision are private and not accessible to anyone through the internet.

Run the following in the command line to provision a private AWS S3 bucket:

```
cf create-service aws-s3-bucket default SERVICE_NAME
```

where `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this S3 bucket.

#### Provision a public AWS S3 bucket

You can provision S3 buckets so they are publicly accessible to everyone through the internet.

Possible use cases for public S3 buckets include:

- storing static objects that you do not want to include with your app
- hosting `404` error pages that work independently of your app

Run the following in the command line to provision a public AWS S3 bucket:

```
cf create-service aws-s3-bucket default SERVICE_NAME -c '{"public_bucket":true}'
```
where `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this S3 bucket.

### Bind an AWS S3 bucket to your app

You must bind the S3 bucket to your app so you can get credentials to use the [AWS S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/) to read from and write to the bucket.

You can bind an S3 bucket using the command line or the manifest. We recommend that you use the command line because you can specify the permissions for the bucket.

Run the following to bind the S3 bucket to your app, selecting the appropriate permission level:

```
cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_NAME -c '{"permissions": "PERMISSION"}'
```

where:

- `APP_NAME` is the name of a deployed instance of your application (as specified in your app's `manifest.yml` file or push command)
- `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this S3 bucket
- `PERMISSION` is the permission level and can be `read-write` or `read-only`

You can use the [app's manifest](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_apps.html#deploying-public-apps) to bind an S3 bucket with read and write permissions to the app. It will bind automatically when you next deploy your app. An example manifest:

```
--
applications:
- name: APP_NAME
  services:
  - SERVICE_NAME
```

### Connect to an S3 bucket from your app

Restart your app to populate your `VCAP_SERVICES` [environment variable](/deploying_apps.html#system-provided-environment-variables) with the credentials needed to connect to the S3 bucket.

An example `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable:

```
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "aws-s3-bucket": [
   {
    "binding_name": null,
    "credentials": {
     "aws_access_key_id": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
     "aws_region": "eu-west-2",
     "aws_secret_access_key": "XXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
     "bucket_name": "paas-s3-broker-prod-lon-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
     "deploy_env": ""
    },
    "instance_name": "my-bucket",
    "label": "aws-s3-bucket",
    "name": "my-bucket",
    "plan": "default",
    "provider": null,
    "syslog_drain_url": null,
    "tags": [
     "s3"
    ],
    "volume_mounts": []
   }
  ]
 }
}
```
You must pass credentials from your `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable to your AWS software development kit (SDK). Use the appropriate [Amazon SDK documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/#sdks) to do this.  

<h2 id="amend-the-service">Use the service</h2>

You can take different actions on an S3 bucket using the [AWS S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/). The actions you are allowed to take depend on your permission level for that bucket.

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

|Description|Command|Permission|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Download an object from S3 bucket|`s3:GetObject`|Read-write, Read-only|
|Upload an object to S3 bucket|`s3:PutObject`|Read-write|
|Delete an object from S3 bucket|`s3:DeleteObject`|Read-write|
|Get AWS region of S3 bucket|`s3:GetBucketLocation`|Read-write, Read-only|
|List objects in S3 bucket|`s3:ListBucket`|Read-write, Read-only|

<div style="height:1px;font-size:1px;">&nbsp;</div>

<h2 id="remove-the-service">Remove the service</h2>

### Unbind an S3 bucket from your app

Run the following in the command line to unbind the S3 bucket from the app:

```
cf unbind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_NAME
```

where:

- `APP_NAME` is the name of a deployed instance of your application (as specified in your app's `manifest.yml` file or push command)
- `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this S3 bucket

If you unbind the S3 bucket from your app but do not delete the bucket, that bucket will persist even after your app is deleted, and you can re-bind or re-connect to the bucket in future.

### Delete an S3 bucket

You must delete all objects from the S3 bucket before you can delete the bucket itself. Use the [AWS S3 API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3api/) to delete objects from the bucket.

You can do this with both read-write and read-only permissions for the bucket.

Run the following in the command line to delete the S3 bucket:

```
cf delete-service SERVICE_NAME
```

where `SERVICE_NAME` is a unique descriptive name for this S3 bucket.

Type `yes` when asked for confirmation.
