# Deploy a backing or routing service

Many 12-factor applications rely on backing services such as a database, an email delivery service or a monitoring system. Routing services can be used to proxy and perform preprocessing on application requests such as caching, rate limiting or authentication.

In Cloud Foundry, backing and routing services are referred to as 'services' and are available through the Cloud Foundry ``cf marketplace`` command. GOV.UK PaaS enables you to create a database service and bind it to your app. The available database services are detailed below.

## PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system. It is open-source and designed to be extensible; currently the postgis and uuid-ossp extensions are enabled.

## MySQL

MySQL is an open source relational database management system that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) and is backed by Oracle.

## MongoDB

MongoDB is an open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. It uses JSON-like documents with schemas, and is often used for content management such as articles on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/). It is currently only available on private beta.

## Redis

Redis is an open-source in-memory data store that can be used as a database cache or message broker. It is currently only available on private beta.

## Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is an open-source full text RESTful search and analytics engine that allows you to store and search data. It is currently only available on private beta.

## Services and plans

Each service in the marketplace can have multiple plans available with different characteristics. For example, there are different PostgreSQL plans which vary by availability, storage capacity and encryption.

Users can also define their own external services that are not available in the marketplace by using [User-Provided Service Instances](/#user-provided-service-instance).

### Paid service plans

Some service plans are paid; you can potentially be billed by us based on your usage of the service. There is a free plan available with limited storage which should only be used for development or testing, not production.

By default, access to paid plans is not enabled for a new organisation. Whether this is enabled or not is controlled by your [organisation's quota settings](/#quotas).

If paid plans are not enabled, when you try to use a paid service you will receive an error stating "service instance cannot be created because paid service plans are not allowed". One of your [Org Managers](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/#org-manager) must contact us at [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) to request that we enable paid services.

### Accessing services

Your app can find out what backing services are available, and obtain credentials for the services, by parsing the VCAP_SERVICES [environment variable](/#environment-variables).

### User-Provided Service Instance

Cloud Foundry enables tenants to define [User-Provided Service Instance](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/user-provided.html) [external link]. They can be used to deliver service credentials to an application, and/or to trigger streaming of application logs to a syslog compatible consumer. Once created, user-provided service instances behave like service instances created through the marketplace.

### Future services

If you need a particular backing service that we don't yet support, please let us know at [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).
