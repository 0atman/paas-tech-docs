##System status, alerts and updates

### Platform availability

GOV.UK PaaS has a [system status page](https://status.cloud.service.gov.uk) showing the availability of live applications and database connectivity. 

We use this system status service to let tenants know about problems with the platform, and so we recommend that you [sign up to receive alerts and updates](https://status.cloud.service.gov.uk/) - particularly if you are using the platform to host production applications.

### Platform updates

You can find out about changes, fixes and upgrades, and hear about new features, by joining our [announcement mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/forum/?hl=en#!forum/gov-uk-paas-announce). If you have trouble signing up, please contact [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) and we will add you manually.
