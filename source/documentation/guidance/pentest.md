## Penetration testing

You must penetration test your app to make sure it’s secure. Note that you can only penetration test your app; you cannot penetration test the platform.

Because GOV.UK PaaS runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS), you need permission from AWS to penetration test your app. The PaaS team will request permission for you because the process requires root credentials for the AWS portal.

Send the below information to [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) and the PaaS team will share it with AWS.

|Tester phone number|
|Emergency email and phone number contact details|
|Do the requests will originate from the tester’s office?|
|Has the tester has signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with AWS?|
|The origin IPs|
|Peak bandwidth that the tests will consume in gigabits per second|
|Peak number of requests per second the tests will perform|
|Start and end dates and times of the test in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ for example 2017-09-26T09:00:00Z|
|The metrics you will measure to decide if the test succeeds or fails|
|Is it possible to stop the test immediately if there is an issue?|

|Supplied by tenant|

|Is the tester a third-party company?|
|What is the purpose of the test and what is being covered?|

You should supply as much information as possible to minimise delays in this process.

AWS responds to permission requests within two business days. The PaaS team will forward the AWS response to you within two further business days of receiving it.

If your request is approved, you will receive an authorisation number. Your penetration test is only authorised for the dates and times you have specified.

If your request is not approved, the PaaS team will work with you and AWS to solve any issues.
