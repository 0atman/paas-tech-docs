# GOV.UK Platform as a Service

GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud-hosting platform built by the Government Digital Service (GDS). GOV.UK PaaS manages the deployment of your apps, services and background tasks so you don’t need to hire people with specialist cloud skills.

GOV.UK PaaS is currently in private beta.

GOV.UK PaaS uses the open source [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) [external link] project, and runs on Amazon Web Services. [Read our blog post](https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/2015/12/17/choosing-cloudfoundry/) [external link] for more information on why we chose Cloud Foundry. Refer to the [features page](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/features) for more information on GOV.UK PaaS.

# Before you start

Before it can start using the platform, your department, agency or team must accept the Terms of Use during account activation.

To be hosted on GOV.UK PaaS, your app must:

- follow the [twelve-factor application principles](/#12-factor-application-principles); this will be true if your app has been written so it can deploy to another PaaS like Heroku
- [store data classified up to ‘official’](/#data-security-classification); your app cannot store data classified as 'secret' or 'top secret'
- be built using a [supported buildpack](/#buildpacks) or written in one of these languages:
    - Go
    - Nodejs
    - Java
    - PHP
    - Python
    - Ruby
    - static HTML/CSS/Javascript site

    >The [.NET Core buildpack](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/dotnet-core/index.html) [external link] is only available as a custom buildpack.

[Cloud Foundry buildpacks](/#buildpacks) provide runtime and framework support for your application. For most languages, you will need to provide configuration files to describe your app’s dependencies. Most buildpacks will support a limited range of versions of the language.

# Get started

## Get an account

Your department, agency or team must have a GOV.UK PaaS account. This account is called an organisation, or [org](/#organisations). Sign up for an org account at [https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/signup](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/signup).

Once your department, agency or team has an org account, you will need an individual account. Ask your [org manager](/#org-manager) to authorise the creation of your individual account.

To provide you with an account, we need to store some personal data about you. Please see our [Privacy Policy](/#privacy-policy) for details.

Once you have an individual account, you can access the [GOV.UK PaaS admin tool](https://admin.cloud.service.gov.uk/) (requires sign in). This tool allows you to, depending on your user role permissions, view and manage your [orgs](/#organisations), [spaces](/#spaces) and [users](/#users-and-user-roles) without using the command line.

Contact us by emailing [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) if you have any questions.

## Set up command line

GOV.UK PaaS is hosted on [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) [external link]. You must use the Cloud Foundry command line interface (CLI) to manage your apps hosted on the GOV.UK PaaS. To set it up:

1. Download and install the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads) [external link] for your platform.

2. To check that it is installed correctly, run `cf -v` in the command line.

    If it has installed correctly, you will receive the `cf version X.X.X…` confirmation message.

    Depending on your network configuration, you might need to set an [`HTTP_PROXY` environment variable](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/http-proxy.html) [external link] for the CLI to connect. Contact your network administrator for your configuration settings.

3. Sign in to Cloud Foundry by running:

    ```
    cf login -a api.cloud.service.gov.uk -u USERNAME
    ```

    where `USERNAME` is your individual account email address.

4. Enter your password (you set this password when you clicked on the invite link in your welcome email).

Once you are logged in, run `cf` in the command line to see all available commands.

## Deploy a test static HTML page

You can practice deploying an app by deploying a test static HTML page.

1. To deploy an app, you must select a [target](/#set-a-target). This is a combination of an [organisation](/#organisations) and a [space](/#spaces).

    All orgs have a sandbox space for you to use when learning about the PaaS. When deploying a test static HTML page, you should target this sandbox space by running:

    ```
    cf target -o ORGNAME -s sandbox
    ```

    where `ORGNAME` is your org and `sandbox` is the name of the sandbox space.

    If you deploy an app using the same name and target as an existing app, the original will be replaced. If you are not sure about where to deploy your app, consult the rest of your team or speak to the PaaS team by emailing [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

2. In an empty directory, create an `index.html` file containing the following markup:.

    ```
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Static Site</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>Welcome to the static site!</p>
      </body>
    </html>
    ```

3. Create a `manifest.yml` file in the same directory as the `index.html` file. The manifest file tells Cloud Foundry what to do with your app.

    ```
    ---
    applications:
    - name: APPNAME
      memory: 64M
      buildpack: staticfile_buildpack
    ```

    where `APPNAME` is the unique name for your app. You can run `cf apps` to see apps which already exist.

    The `memory` line tells the PaaS how much memory to allocate to the app.

    A buildpack provides app framework and runtime support. For example, if your app was written in Ruby, you would use the `ruby_buildpack`. In this example, we use the `staticfile_buildpack` for the static HTML page.

4. In the directory where you created the files, run `cf push APPNAME` to push the static HTML page to the GOV.UK PaaS.

    If you do not specify the app name in `cf push`, the name specified in the manifest file is used.

    The static HTML page is now available at `https://APPNAME.cloudapps.digital`.

For a production app, you should read the [production checklist](/#production-checklist).
