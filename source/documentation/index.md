# GOV.UK Platform as a Service

GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud-hosting platform built by the Government Digital Service (GDS). GOV.UK PaaS manages the deployment of your apps, services and background tasks so you donâ€™t need to hire people with specialist cloud skills.

GOV.UK PaaS is currently in private beta.

GOV.UK PaaS uses the open source [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) [external link] project, and runs on Amazon Web Services. [Read our blog post](https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/2015/12/17/choosing-cloudfoundry/) [external link] for more information on why we chose Cloud Foundry. Refer to the [features page](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/features) for more information on GOV.UK PaaS.
