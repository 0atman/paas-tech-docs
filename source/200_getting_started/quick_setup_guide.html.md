## Quick setup guide

### Getting an account

GOV.UK PaaS is currently in private beta.

If your organisation is already taking part in the private beta and you need an account, please talk to your manager who will need to authorise creating your account.

If you'd like to find out about taking part in the beta, please contact us by emailing [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk).

In order to provide you with an account, we need to store some personal data about you. Please see [our Privacy Policy](/#privacy-policy) for details.

### Setting up the command line

GOV.UK PaaS uses a hosting technology called Cloud Foundry. As a tenant (that is, someone who is hosting an application on the PaaS), you will use the Cloud Foundry command line client to interact with the PaaS. To set it up:

1. Download and install the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads" target="blank">Cloud Foundry CLI for your platform </a> [external page, opens in new tab]

     *Note:* On macOS Sierra, installing with Homebrew does not work. We recommend using the Mac binary or installer.

2. To check that it installed correctly, go to the Terminal/command line/Command Prompt and run:

    ```
    cf -v
    ```

    You should get a message like this, confirming the version that's installed:

    ```
    cf version X.X.X...
    ```

    *Note:* depending on your network configuration you might need to [set an ```HTTP_PROXY``` environment variable](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/http-proxy.html) [external link] for the CLI to connect. Contact your network administrators to work out the correct settings for your configuration.  

3. Log in by running:

    ```
    cf login -a api.cloud.service.gov.uk -u USERNAME
    ```

    Your `USERNAME` is your email address your account was created with.

    You will then be prompted to enter your password. You set this when you clicked on the invite link in your welcome email.

Once logged in, you can see the available commands by running ```cf```.


### Deploying a test app

To practice deploying an app, try following the process to [deploy a static site](/#deploy-a-static-site).

To clean up look at our instructions on [stopping and deleting apps](#stopping-and-deleting-apps).
